# A Python Analysis of Election Poll Data

## Overview of Election Analysis

### Purpose
This analysis is to use Python programming to determine significant metrics from the Election. The dataset identifies Voter ID, County, and Candidate Vote Counts. This data is recalled in a Python script to return quantitative values: # of Total Votes, # votes by County, largest County  Turnout, Total Candidate votes and percentages, and the Winning candidate counts. Furthermore, we use For and If And iterations to count the specific Candidate votes for the overall and County total vote counts.

---

- The total votes casted equals 369,711. 

- The county votes and percentage of total votes by county were Arapahoe with 6.7% of the vote & 24,801 votes, Jefferson with 10.5% of the vote & 38,855 votes, and the largest voting county Denver with 82.8% of the vote & 306,055 votes.

- Denver has the largest number of votes by an overwhelming majority.

- The candidate votes and percentage of total votes by candidate were Raymon Anthony Doane with 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes, Charles Casper Stockham with 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes, and Diana DeGette with 73.8% percent of the vote and 272,892 votes. 

- Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes and 73.8% of the total vote count. 



## Election Audit and Analysis Summary
	
The Election Commission will find the Python script useful for future elections by manipulatiing the script so it is applicable in several different election cases. By modifying the script to read larger datasets, the Election Commission can segment the datasets by virtue of script calculated metrics such as Total Candidate Votes and County Vote Share for similar analysis. 

### Practical Script Use

1. A practical method the script can be modified is by manipulating the code to show the candidate vote totals by county. By doing so, we can futher analyze where campaigns were most successfull and where to allocate future campaign budgets.
2. Another practical method the script can be modified is by increase the loops to assess larger datasets and even more metrics. For example we could further break down the county category with zip codes and their corresponding property values. We can then provide an indepth analysis into the wealth of voters and determine a correlation with voting patterns.
